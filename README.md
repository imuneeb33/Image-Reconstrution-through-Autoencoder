# Image-Reconstrution-through-Autoencoder
This repository provides an implementation of an autoencoder for image reconstruction using the MNIST dataset. Code for model, training, evaluation and visualization included. Simple architecture serves as starting point for more complex tasks. Code is well commented and results can be visualized using Matplotlib.
