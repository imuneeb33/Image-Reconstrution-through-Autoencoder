# Image-Reconstrution-through-Autoencoder
Welcome to the "Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction" repository!

This repository contains a Python implementation of an autoencoder for image reconstruction using the MNIST dataset. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct handwritten digits by learning a compact representation of the images. The repository includes the following files:

autoencoder.py: This file contains the implementation of the autoencoder model, including the encoder and decoder networks.
train.py: This file includes the code for training the autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.
evaluate.py: This file includes the code for evaluating the performance of the trained autoencoder on the test set and visualizing the results.
requirements.txt: This file lists the required python packages to run the code in this repository.
data: This folder contains the MNIST dataset used in this project.
The implemented autoencoder has a simple architecture, with only a few layers, and a relatively small number of neurons, it serves as a starting point for more advanced and complex tasks. The code is well commented and easy to follow, and the results can be visualized using Matplotlib.

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the packages listed in requirements.txt installed. You can install the packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

To train the autoencoder, run the train.py file and to evaluate the performance of the trained autoencoder on the test set, run the evaluate.py file. You can also modify the code to suit your needs and experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.

Please note that the code and the dataset provided in this repository are for educational purposes
